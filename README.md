## W200 Python Fundamental for Data science

- Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming
- Data Structures
- EDA in Python (pandas, numpy, matpotlib)
- Git (not exactly python but this was important)
- Pseudo-coding
- Mid Term Project: [BBQ Management system](https://github.com/iatechicken/ucbmids/blob/master/W200/BBQ_MGMT_revised.py)
    - First python program I ever wrote! A restaurant management application for my friend's Korean BBQ restaurant

## W203 Statistics for Data Science

- Final Project: Linear Regression on North Carolina Crime data

    - The consulting group Significant Effects, comprised of data scientists Jeff Li, Vasanth Ramani, and Richard Ryu, has been tasked by a political campaign to identify determinants of crime

    - [pdf version](./W203/sig_eff.pdf)

    - Came up with 3 different linear regression models to predict crime in North Carolina

    - Evaluate the models through: CLM assumptions and fit

    - [final results](./W203/final.png)
