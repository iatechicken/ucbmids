## W200 Python Fundamental for Data science

- Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming
- Data Structures
- EDA in Python (pandas, numpy, matpotlib)
- Git (not exactly python but this was important)
- Pseudo-coding
- Mid Term Project: [BBQ Management system](https://github.com/iatechicken/ucbmids/blob/master/W200/BBQ_MGMT_revised.py)
    - First python program I ever wrote! A restaurant management application for my friend's Korean BBQ restaurant

- Final Project: [Bechdel Analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vHQwoAiBGeFzBr6I7qQ5OstKaOVww4e4v5RFkw12f6o/edit?usp=sharing)

    - Used pandas on webscraped data from Box Office Mojo and IMDB

## W203 Statistics for Data Science

- Probability Theory and foundational understanding of classical statistics and how it fits within the broader context of data science

- learned and used R for most assignments

- Final Project: Linear Regression on North Carolina Crime data

    - The consulting group Significant Effects, comprised of data scientists Jeff Li, Vasanth Ramani, and Richard Ryu, has been tasked by a political campaign to identify determinants of crime

    - [pdf version](./W203/sig_eff.pdf)

    - Came up with 3 different linear regression models to predict crime in North Carolina

    - Evaluate the models through: CLM assumptions and fit

## W205 Fundamentals of Data Engineering

- First introduction to the world of dockers, cloud services (GCP), data pipeline, query, transformation, and streaming

- Final Project: Instrument an API server to catch and analyze events for a mobile gaming company

    - Each weekly assignments build up to the final project where we put it all together in a single data pipeline. We leverage:

        - dockers
        - Kafka
        - Flask
        - Hadoop HDFS
        - PySpark SQL
        - Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Numpy
