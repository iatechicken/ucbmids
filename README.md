Reflecting on my time at UC Berkeley Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS)

Kind of off-topic but I hope this intro makes sense into why I'm writing such a long post. Senior year of junior high school, it was our last home game of the junior varsity hockey team. Everything felt normal until the moment our coach said "This is the last time you'll be skating on this ice". At the time, I didn't think too much of it... but 15 years later... he was right and those words are the only thing I vividly remember. I can't remember who we were playing nor how I played, but that's really the only thing I remember from that game. I really wish there was some documentation of that moment.

Now, my time at UC Berkeley MIDS is sadly coming to an end. There were countless nights when I thought that this day would never come as I was staring at the error logs, but it's actually happening. Knowing that I'll miss my time at UCB MIDS, I am going to write about it so that this article can:

1. Help others better understand the UCB MIDS experience

2. Save others from reading my boring resume

3. Help me remember the good times

DISCLAIMER: I'm not being paid and this is my personal experience/opinion

## Intro

I came from a non-technical background (studied public health) and had close to 0 coding experience when I was applying for MIDS. Now some might ask, "why?", and I can give you the generic answer of "data science is my passion etc.". But not here.

At the time (early 2018), I was a tech consultant that specialized in pharma company's business intelligence reports. This involved lot of spreadsheets, manual documentation, and SQL. After witnessing the rise of AWS and bitcoin mania, it was hard to ignore AI, Data Science, and tech. I first enrolled for Andrew Ng's Intro to Machine Learning on Coursera, but quickly realized that I lacked the fundamentals such as Linear Algebra and Statistics. This is where I found out about MIDS and the fact that I can use my GMAT score for their application instead of studying and taking GRE. Perfect.

So yeah... I started MIDS with no programming experience, some SQL experience and a lot of worries, but was more than happy to find 15 other classmates who were in the same situation!

## W200 Python Fundamental for Data science

In retrospect, this class was really challenging at first for a non-technical student like myself. Just look at one of the hw questions from week 2:
```
Create a python script with a 'while' loop that does something like this!

Input: Paul
Output: Luap

Input: Hannah
Ouput: Hannah
Palindrome!
```

Imagine working on this script for an entire weekend and still being stuck during the 2nd week of class. This was when I started to doubt, am I really cut for this? Is this what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life? However, this was also the moment that really defined MIDS for me. As I was struggling with all the new python syntax, I truly got to take advantage of a collaborative classroom environment where students and TAs go out of their way to help each other. If there were hard problems, we worked together and help each other with code reviews without making it too obvious. Everyone was very professional and someone always had a great idea to solve the hard problems. With all the help, I was able to survive my first class at UCB MIDS, Python FUndamental for Data Science. Below are some course highlights:

- Object Oriented programming
- Data Structures
- Git (not exactly python but this was important)
- Mid Term Project: BBQ Management system
- Final Project: Bechdel Analysis
