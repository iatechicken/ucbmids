Right now it is like playing with blocks in a vacuum: limited output nodes and iOS does not let Shortcuts know what is going on outside. I have to make broad assumptions about when most of these shortcuts will fire, my playlist being an exception because it is completely contained in my phone. I understand the desire for privacy and not executing arbitrary programs no matter how small, but Shortcuts is advertised as being able to order your favorite coffee at your favorite cafe. If it is allowed to touch my credit cards, why is it not able to know my location and the viable routes to my destination and the travel time of each route the way some apps can if I go the long route? In other words, if I make the shortcut or give it off of the approved gallery and other apps cannot make shortcuts, what is wrong with making a delayed text message or other shortcuts that do arbitrary things? This a toy, demonstrated by the gallery still only having 50 shortcuts a year later. I request that we be allowed to go deeper, because clever use of websites allows for arbitrary exploitation in a way that is more likely to involve bad actors.'}"

Right now it is like playing with blocks in a vacuum: limited output nodes and iOS does not let Shortcuts know what is going on outside. I have to make broad assumptions about when most of these shortcuts will fire, my playlist being an exception because it is completely contained in my phone. I understand the desire for privacy and not executing arbitrary programs no matter how small, but Shortcuts is advertised as being able to order your favorite coffee at your favorite cafe. If it is allowed to touch my credit cards, why is it not able to know my location and the viable routes to my destination and the travel time of each route the way some apps can if I go the long route? In other words, if I make the shortcut or give it off of the approved gallery and other apps cannot make shortcuts, what is wrong with making a delayed text message or other shortcuts that do arbitrary things? This a toy, demonstrated by the gallery still only having 50 shortcuts a year later. I request that we be allowed to go deeper, because clever use of websites allows for arbitrary exploitation in a way that is more likely to involve bad actors.\n",

I feel the shortcut features could be better/easier to understand for the basic user.  I also feel not enough apps support this feature.  When they do it‚Äôs just one command and not enough to work with.   Once other apps start adding more ability to use shortcuts in their apps this will be great.

So I can get it to tell me how long it‚Äôs going to take to get to work in the morning but will not get any indication of which of the numerous routes it‚Äôs referring to. Ok, no problem, I‚Äôll get directions and parse out some route details... nope, the only map directions-related actions open the Maps app, you can‚Äôt just have it return text. I don‚Äôt want or need this because I‚Äôm not going to navigate a route I drive multiple times a week, I just want ‚Äú19 mins via Highway 123‚Äù.
